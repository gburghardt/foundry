Foundry is a modern, object oriented JavaScript framework built for speed of development, flexibility and file size.

2. <del>Integrate `Module` classes</del>
3. <del>Create an Application class to bring everything together</del>
4. <del>Use dependency injection</del>
5. <del>Create a functional demo</del>
6. Add support for JavaScript package managers such as NPM
7. Add support for a template layer to Modules
8. Add support for models
9. Create Wiki documenting everything (an ongoing process)
