## {{ page.title }}

<h3 class="intro">
	Foundry is free, open source, and ready for you to contribute! Here's how.
</h3>

To develop Foundry, you will need:

- NodeJS
- Grunt
- Bower
- Jasmine

All development and bug fixes will be handled on [GitHub][issues].

## Submitting a Bug Fix or Feature

1. [Fork the repository][fork] on GitHub
2. Create a branch to encompass the bug fix or feature. If an [issue][issues]
   was created, put the issue Id in the branch name.
3. Submit a [pull request][pulls]
4. __Do not commit the concatenated files__. We will do that once your branch
   has been merged in, just before a release.

For bugs, include what went wrong, how to reproduce it and what impact it has.

For features, include a description and reason this should be added.
